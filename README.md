Hello!


I'm Gabriel Martins, 19 years old student of Computer Engineering at FURG.

I like coding, and sometimes I make some small projects, like discord bots, websites, games, etc.

On my free time I like to play video games, watch TV shows and read books!

My profile pic is my beloved dog, Florinda ðŸ¥°
